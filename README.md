# Project Pet

Project Pet is a small [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game) style demo.  
It was created back in 2015 as a part of a hackathon.

Due to the hackathon's short/limited time,  
we decided that by the end of it, the demo should meet the following points:  
* Research and decide the framework and libraries to use in the project.
* Decide the initial structure of the game engine.
* Work on basic implementation of some of the game mechanics and functionalities for the demo.

The project was closed source as it contained copyrighted assets  
and the code required (still requires) more work, refactoring and improvement.  
(Some parts must be redone properly from scratch.)  
And we actually worked on it just for fun and to learn something new/different by execution,  
and to leave the comfort zone for some time.

In the open source version,  
I replaced the copyrighted [BGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_music) files with [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) ones,  
and replaced the colored images with silhouette versions of them.  
I also fixed some issues.

The used soundtrack (done by [t4ngr4m](https://opengameart.org/users/t4ngr4m)) can be found here:

There are multiple places in the code that are still incomplete  
and other parts were a bit rushed, as there wasn't enough time to work on them.

The project was mainly built using CreateJS suite libraries.

Other libraries were also used, such as:
* [AlaSQL](https://github.com/agershun/alasql)
* [RequireJS](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs)
