# Project Pet

Project Pet is a small [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game) style demo.  
It was created back in 2015 as a part of a short hackathon.

It was closed source as it contained copyrighted assets  
and the code required (still requires) more work, refactoring and improvement.  
(Some parts must be done properly from scratch.)  
And we actually worked on it just for fun and to learn something new/different by execution.

In the open source version,  
I replaced the copyrighted [BGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_music) files with [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) ones,  
and replaced the colored images with silhouette versions of them.  
I also fixed couple of issues.

The used soundtrack (done by [t4ngr4m](https://opengameart.org/users/t4ngr4m)) can be found here:

There are multiple places in the code that are still incomplete  
due to lack of time to work on them.

The project was mainly built using CreateJS.

Other libraries were also used, such as:
* [AlaSQL](https://github.com/agershun/alasql)
* [RequireJS](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs)
